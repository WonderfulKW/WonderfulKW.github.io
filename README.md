The following are my data analytics projects.   

## Project 1： BigMart Sales Prediction  
### Why do I choose this subject?   
As a data analyst, I choose to work on the BigMart sales data analysis project because it offers an opportunity to gain insights into the operations of a large supermarket chain. The project is focused on building a sales forecasting model that can assist decision-makers in predicting the sales status of individual products in specific stores. By analyzing the large amount of data generated by customers while shopping, I can identify the relationships between different variables and offer recommendations for improving the overall sales situation. By optimizing inventory management, product placement, and other aspects of operations, the BigMart can increase sales and maintain a competitive advantage in the highly competitive retail industry. The project offers a challenging and rewarding opportunity to apply data analysis techniques to real-world business problems and drive meaningful impact.    

### Purpose of This Project:  
This project aims to develop a sales forecasting model for BigMart, predicting the sales status of each product in a store. The model will help optimize inventory management, product placement, and other operational aspects, ultimately improving the overall sales situation.
