The following are my data analytics projects.   

## Project 1： BigMart Sales Prediction  
### Why did I choose this subject?   
    Profit is one of the primary goals of every supermarket. Sales data analysis provides insight into business operations. The vast amount of data generated by customers as they shop in supermarkets reflects their spending habits. Using the sales forecasting model, supermarket managers can predict product sales by establishing the specific relationship between variables. The manager is able to know when to replenish inventory, arrange the location of items on the shelf to improve its visibility, etc. It will help the BigMart increase sales and maintain competitive advantages.
